Appendix of Protocol Actions (Commands)


Protocols are queued up as either "Sample Prep", "Mass Spec", or "Fractionation" methods.
These are not strict limiters. 
You can, for example, run a "mass spec" method without using a mass spec or even LC.
The distinction is in the variables provided when compiling a queue. 
Some protocol actions (commands) expect variables such as "sample well",
    which are not provided until the method is queued.
This allows one method to be compiled for a series of runs.

"Sample Preparation" is useful when treating all samples simultaneously, 
    and the only run time variable needed is the method file itself.

"Mass Spectrometry" is useful when you wish to specify a target sample at run time.
Some protocal actions depend on the variables provided in the mass specrtometry queue page,
    and are exclusive to "Mass Spectrometry" methods. See Below.

"Fractionation" is similar to "Mass Spectrometry" but with additional variables for elution wells.
